# TO DO / TO DISCUSS

## FAXE & FYN
* Fyn: suggestion: simplified code (with tailored data) and provide ready-made QGIS project and simplified instructions to run it themselves 
* Faxe: suggestion: simplified code as for Fyn, but provide ready-made QGIS project and plots/screenshots
* Q: own github repos or just branches? (code and data will be differently structured)
* Q: letÂ´s check the questions, do they make sense?

## SCRIPT UPDATES / FEATURE REQUESTS
* have the map in projected crs by default
* after 01b, display (zoom to map)
* add "this will take time to load" print out and "finished script XY" to all scripts where appropriate
* update visualizations on evaluation (thicker linewidths, different colors etc.)
* elevation: visualization isn't quite working?; group differently (set fixed elevation values to group by)

## SEPTIMA
* provide septima data SEPARATELY and independently from Septima WFS (download for entire DK; for Faxe; and for Fyn) and adjust 03a script for both Faxe and Fyn
* right now can't access data at all? (through web app)

## FYN
* how to access WFS data?
* remove 00_ and create a fyn polygon instead

## FAXE
* remove 00_ and create a faxe polygon instead

## PAPER
* venues? [(see here)](docs/VENUES.md)
* Q to DKNT?
