## Current TO DOs

### CODE

* **Ane: plot "evaluation layers" plus plot "evaluated network"**

* **Anastassia** try to find a way to import functions from src?

* **Anastassia** check why we get an error message about index_parts from the `create_osmnx_graph` function

* Take into account the parallel edges in evaluation

* wrap everything relating Septima data (download of WFS) into a try/except

* wrap everything relating Septima data (evaluation) into a try except (cases: no data at all; or data but df is empty)

* work on documentation

* Write an evaluation script (point of departure can be `_10_compare_networks`, but don't do comparison)

* Implement evaluation based on network metrics

### OTHER

* work on papers (2x)

* read process&method handbook

* receive Faxe data from Kirsten

* receive technical specifications (septima) doc from Kirsten

* receive folkersma's process description from Kirsten



## Later TO DOs

* add a config file where one can decide *which* septima layers to add

* figure out how the import of src. scripts works (cross-platform...)

* docker?!

* What to do when septima database is down? Alternative setup for using data stored on disk? --> Just store data to geopackage as it is now when downloaded from WFS connection

* convert EVERYTHING to native qgis (all geopandas functions that we can)

* think about a **timeline**
