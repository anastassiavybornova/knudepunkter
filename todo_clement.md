- The naming of the parts is not obvious, you call "Step 1: Set up QGIS" but then you mention the 2nd part of this (i.e. 1.2) to be step 2 in 1.5: "Use the path from step 2" but then we have "Step 2: Download the contents of this repository". I feel like it's better to call subparts to make sure that it's clear what you are referring to.
- I guess the size is still small enough and nowadays that's not an issue, but I feel that specifying the amount of memory space needed for the entire installation when it's a couple of Go is always a nice heads-up, with both QGIS and the repo it's something like 5 Go. Everyone should be able to install it but why not.
- In 1.1, you say "The Cycle Node Network Planner was developed to run with QGIS-LTR 3.28 Firenze, but might also work with later versions.", it's not a big deal but the tutorial is made in 3.28.12, which is not the LTR version, which is 3.28.14. That's innocuous but everyone installing the LTR will get the warning, and the LTR is probably the one most people will install if they don't have a version installed already.
- In 1.5, you say "Use the path from step 2". To make sure that we understand, I think it might be better to say "the path to your folder found in step 2" or something like this, otherwise someone who is not paying attention might try to copy-paste the one you are giving while it's not the one on his machine.
- Still in 1.5, the screenshot is nice but I guess it's even better if you specify that the big WARNING that we get every time because it's not on PATH is not an issue in our case. I don't know what kind of people will use it but if they are not used to receive random warning from software that might scare them that they are doing something wrong.
- In 3. when you say "Provide the study area name of your choice, in quotation marks (the default is "Fyn")." we don't know what are the other options. For the municipalities there is the URL link and a list where we can make our choice but for the study area it's not clear. Also, as far as I saw there is every municipality listed except Copenhagen, is there a specific reason ? If there is a reason might be good to say either here or in some kind of F.A.Q. what are the available choices.
- Still in 3., I'm not sure to understand what impact have the study area and the municipalities included. The study area I think I understand based on the visuals you put, but it's not obvious on the main page of the GitHub or in this tutorial the impact of the municipalities included. I guess a link here to explain more thoroughly might be nice. Because it also begs the question of couldn't you make a big project file already computed by you, and let users explore, maybe giving tools to filter that huge thing, instead of having them to compute it ? It would be easier for the user and probably faster too if that's possible. But since I don't know how it works I cannot say if that's even feasible ahah, just curious of your thought process
- In 4. you say to open Fyn.qgz, is it a file created based on the config.yml, a name for the tutorial... ? Because you say in the step before that we can change the study area name, so it's not very clear if we should open an empty file with the name of the area selected in 3. or always Fyn.
- In 5., how familiar with QGIS are people targeted ? Because the Python Console is not directly visible, so explaining that we find it in Extensions, with screenshots, might be useful if people are not supposed to be familiar with it.
- Still in 5. feels a bit heavier to the user to open and run consecutively every script instead of launching a single one. But since each one of them is quite long and the solution to issues is to save and restart, I understand why.
- Still in 5., maybe put somewhere a list of the layers and files created by each script ? Because otherwise if there is an issue "remove layers added by the script, and delete the files created by the script (including temporary/partial files)" it's hard to know which ones they are. I don't know what I need to remove to make it work. I have tried from scratch 2 times and it's working up until the 5th script then it's never working even after launching it again a dozen times removing the added layers, but maybe I'm missing some files that are created that I should remove somewhere :sweat_smile:.
- In 5.7, "at the top of each script..." feels a bit too vague maybe something like "At the beginning of the script, line 4 is a variable...", something making super explicit that it's inside the script and that it corresponds to this line. Maybe same for 5.8.
- Since I didn't manage to go through the 5th script, I opened Fyn-finished for 6. and 7., and dem_terrain is considered to be unusable instantly on my computer. But oustide of that it's working flawlessly, very informative, lots of things to look, having the plot summary is very nice, that's great !
