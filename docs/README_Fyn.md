Will send link to this website, where Fyn colleagues will find:

* Intro about the project
* Goal of our contribution
* How to use this:
    - to just see the ready-made QGIS project: download the dropbox folder
    - to DIY: follow the instructions on setup & script running (1 detailed md each)
* What you get as result (explanation of QGIS project layers + screenshot) (+1 detailed md on layers)
    - Polygon layers: Nature, Culture, Undesirable, Agriculture, Summerhouse
    - Point layers: POIs, facilities, service
    - Elevation data
* What we want to know from you:
    - if you ran the scripts yourself: is the technical setup clear, reproducible? did you have any issues? 
    - in the final qgis project: do the summarized layers make sense? - are they helpful for assessing the network?
    - is elevation data helpful?
    - does the presented data (point and polygon layers) help you get a better understanding of the area?
    - are the summary statistics helpful?
    - what information are you missing?
    - how can visualization be improved? 
    - general thoughts/remarks?
