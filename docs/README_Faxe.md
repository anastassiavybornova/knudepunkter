Will send link to this website, where colleagues will find:

* Intro about the project
* Goal of our contribution
* How to use this:
    - to see screenshots / PNGs of results: go to github link...
    - to see the ready-made QGIS project: download the dropbox folder
* What you get as result (explanation of QGIS project layers + screenshot) (+1 detailed md on layers)
* What we want to know from you:
    - do the summarized layers make sense? - are they helpful for assessing the network?
    - is elevation data helpful?
    - does the presented data (point and polygon layers) help you get a better understanding of the area?
    - are the summary statistics helpful?
    - what information are you missing?
    - how can visualization be improved? 
    - general thoughts/remarks?
