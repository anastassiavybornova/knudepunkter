With this project, we want to assist the planning of [knudepunktnetsv√¶rker](https://www.kystognaturturisme.dk/cykelknudepunkter) (cycle node networks) in Denmark and beyond. This repository contains a set of scripts and detailed instructions. The user can run all scripts with step-by-step explanations in their QGIS Python console. The scripts help the user to:

* Define the area of interest (a part of Denmark)
* Fetch and process spatial data (Septima) & beta network data (GeoFA, provided by Folkersma) for this area
* Evaluate the beta network based on spatial data & network structure
* Visualize and explore results of the analysis in QGIS

## Setup

1. You need QGIS-LTR 3.28 Firenze (can be downloaded [here](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html))  
2. Find out the path to the Python installation for the QGIS app on your local machine, e.g. `/Applications/QGIS-LTR.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/python3.9`. 
3. Use this path (abbreviated as `<qgispythonpath>` below) to run from terminal, in indicated order:  
    - `<qgispythonpath> -m pip install --upgrade shapely`  
    - `<qgispythonpath> -m pip install --upgrade geopandas --force-reinstall -v geopandas==0.14.0`
    - `<qgispythonpath> -m pip install momepy`  
    - `<qgispythonpath> -m pip install osmnx`  
    - `<qgispythonpath> -m pip install numpy --force-reinstall -v numpy==1.22.4`

<!-- OSMNX should be installed as /Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/python3.9 -m pip install osmnx==1.6.0 -->

## Running the scripts

After completing the setup:
1. Download this repository to your local machine
2. Open QGIS
3. In QGIS, open a new (empty) QGIS project
4. Save the QGIS project in the main folder of the repository
5. Open the Python console plugin in QGIS (`Plugins > Python Console`)
6. On top of the QGIS Python console, press the `Show editor` button to view the editor 
7. In this QGIS Python console editor, **open** and then **run** the scripts in indicated order (01, 02, ...)
